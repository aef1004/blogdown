Hello! I'm Amy, and I'm a PhD student at Colorado State University. I'm currently testing the efficacy of different tuberculosis vaccines in mice, and I'm working on developing an R-based data analysis pipeline for flow cytometry data. When I'm not working in the lab, I like to travel and experience new food and cultures.
