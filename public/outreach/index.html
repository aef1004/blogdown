<h1>Graduate Women in Science Outreach Committee</h1>
<p>Currently, I serve as the Graduate Women in Science Outreach Committee Co-Chair at Colorado State University. The outreach committee started in 2017 with the goal to engage community members to teach them about STEM-related topics.</p>
<p>In April 2018 I helped facilitate a Crime Scene Activity with Brownies where we</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussed how microbes can be used to determine the time of death of a body</li>
<li>Participated in a microbial clock activity to determine time of death based on different microbes (candy) present</li>
</ul>
<p>In May 2018, I helped Junior receive their Animal Habitats Badge when we</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussed different animal habitats and how soil is a habitat as well</li>
<li>Dissected and sorted a soil core into soil, animals, and decomposing material</li>
<li>Played a food web game to learn about the interconnectedness of ecosystems</li>
</ul>

<div id="science-olympiad" class="section level1">
<h1>Science Olympiad</h1>
<p>In Fall 2017, I co-coached two Science Olympiad Classes at Preston Middle School: Potions &amp; Poisons and Crimebusters for a few hours every Tuesday afternoon after school.</p>
</div>
<div id="brain-awareness-week" class="section level1">
<h1>Brain Awareness Week</h1>
<p>I was trained to facilitate Brain Awareness Week activities in local middle and high schools. I presented a poster on visual perception at Lincoln Middle School to about 40 students.</p>
</div>
<div id="mentoring-at-baylor-college-of-medicine" class="section level1">
<h1>Mentoring at Baylor College of Medicine</h1>
<p>I have trained new researchers in different wet lab techniques. I worked with a high school student and taught her how to perform western blots on serum samples. Additionally, I taught a PhD student how to optimize and runa series of ELISAs to determine if pigs develop antibodies against tick saliva.</p>
</div>
<div id="volunteers-around-the-world" class="section level1">
<h1>Volunteers Around the World</h1>
<p>On a medical outreach trip, I was a part of 20 volunteers that set up clinics in plazas in Cusco, Peru. We fund-raised money for medicine before the trip, and once there, performed triage, assisted doctors, and provided free medicine to nearly 200 people who came through the clinic each day.</p>
